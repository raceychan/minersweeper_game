we use uv to setup virtual env
for all command you are going to execute, you might execute it with 

`uv run {command}`

for example:

python -m src

`uv run python -m src`

## testing
we should  use pytest for testing

install it with `uv add pytest` if it is not installed.

to run test
`uv run pytest`
